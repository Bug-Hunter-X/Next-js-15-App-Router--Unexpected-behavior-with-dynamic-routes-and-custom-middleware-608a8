# Next.js 15 App Router: Unexpected Behavior with Dynamic Routes and Custom Middleware

This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior in Next.js 15's App Router when combining dynamic routes and custom middleware. The issue manifests as incorrect route matching or unexpected behavior in the middleware function.

## Bug Description

The provided code demonstrates an issue where custom middleware does not function correctly with dynamic routes in the Next.js 15 App Router. When a specific route pattern is used along with middleware, the middleware does not intercept requests as expected. The bug involves unexpected route behavior, where the middleware may not execute, or may execute for the wrong route.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Access various routes. Observe the unexpected behavior in the console logs and responses.

## Expected Behavior

The middleware should correctly intercept and execute for all matching dynamic routes.

## Actual Behavior

The middleware does not function correctly with the dynamic routes. This causes incorrect rendering or prevents functionality based on conditions specified in the middleware.

## Solution

This bug is solved by improving the route handling and middleware logic in the Next.js app. The solution involves carefully checking the routing structure and ensuring proper matching patterns in both the route configuration and the middleware function.
